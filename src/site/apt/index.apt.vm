Introduction

  Calculate easter and feast days based on easter.
  The class de.javanarior.utils.calendar.eastern.EasterCalculator contains method to calculate easter
and related moveable feast days. The Penance Day is a exception. This day is based on the Wednesday before the 23th, November.
Currently the following feast days could be calculated:

  * Shrove Monday

  * Shrove Tuesday

  * Ash Wednesday

  * Holy Thursday

  * Good Friday

  * Easter Sunday

  * Easter Monday

  * Ascension Day

  * Whit Sunday

  * Whit Monday

  * Corpus Christi

  * Penance Day

  The calculation of Easter Sunday is performed after the extended Version of the Easter Formula of Gau√ü. I used the
notion of Heiner Lichtenberg. More information in German could be found here
